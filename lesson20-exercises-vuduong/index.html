                <p class="quote">What is a sports car? A car may be a sporting automobile without being a sports car.
                </p>
                <p class="text">A sports car, or sportscar, is a small, usually two-seater, two-door automobile designed
                    for spirited performance and nimble handling. The term "sports car" was used in The Times, London in
                    1919. According to USA's Merriam-Webster dictionary, USA's first known use of the term was in 1928.
                    Sports cars started to become popular during the 1920s.</p>
                <p class="text">Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious, but high maneuverability and light weight are
                    requisite. Sports cars are usually aerodynamically shaped (since the 1950s), and have a low center
                    of gravity compared to standard models. Steering and suspension are typically designed for precise
                    control at high speeds. Traditionally sports cars were open roadsters, but closed coup√©s also
                    started to become popular during the 1930s, and the distinction between a sports car and a grand
                    tourer is not absolute.</p>

                <p class="quote">Traditional sports cars were typically two-seat roadsters.</p>
                <p class="text">Although the first sports cars were derived from fast tourers, and early sporting
                    regulations often demanded four seats (even three-seaters were often produced by coachbuilders), two
                    seats became common from about the mid-1920s. Modern sports cars may also have small back seats that
                    are often really only suitable for luggage or small children; such a configuration is referred to as
                    a 2+2 (two full seats + two "occasional" seats).</p>
                <p class="text">Over the years, some manufacturers of sports cars have sought to increase the
                    practicality of their vehicles by increasing the seating room. One method is to place the driver's
                    seat in the center of the car, which allows two full-sized passenger seats on each side and slightly
                    behind the driver. The arrangement was originally considered for the Lamborghini Miura, but
                    abandoned as impractical because of the difficulty for the driver to enter/exit the vehicle. McLaren
                    used the design in their F1.</p>
